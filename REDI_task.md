### Task: Open-Ended Image Dataset Curation

#### Objective
In this task, you will learn how to curate a dataset of images on a subject of your interest. By following a step-by-step tutorial, you will be able to create an image dataset using Google Images and some machine learning. This open-ended project allows you to explore and curate images related to a theme that intrigues you, providing a hands-on experience in dataset creation, cleaning, and management.

#### Instructions:

1. **Choose a Theme or Subject of Interest**: Select a specific theme or subject that you are interested in. It could be anything from art, animals, plants, architecture, or even abstract concepts. **Think about a problem that you would like to solve and how it would benefit from using image data**. 

2. **Follow the Tutorial**: Navigate to the [tutorial on PyImageSearch](https://pyimagesearch.com/2017/12/04/how-to-create-a-deep-learning-dataset-using-google-images/) and follow the instructions provided. This tutorial will guide you through the process of collecting images from Google and organizing them into a usable dataset.

3. **Install Necessary Tools**: Ensure that you have all the required tools and libraries installed on your system as mentioned in the tutorial.

4. **Clean Your Dataset**: As you follow the [tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/andandandand/image-dataset-curation/tree/main/notebooks), curate the images according to your chosen theme. **This is the most important part of the task and where most of your effort will go.** Pay attention to the quality and relevance of the images. If you train an image classifier, consider issues such as mislabeled or duplicated images. 

7. **Document Your Process**: Keep a record of the steps you took, any challenges you faced, and how you overcame them. This will help you reflect on your learning experience.

8. **Analyze and Reflect**: Once you have curated your dataset, analyze the collection, and reflect on what you have learned. Consider questions such as:
   - What did you find interesting about the process?
   - How can this dataset be used in an analytics project?
   - What considerations (ethical and practical) did you take into account while curating the dataset?

9. **Submit Your Work**: Provide the curated dataset to your mentor along with a report detailing your process, reflections, and any additional insights you gained from this task.

#### Evaluation Criteria
- Quality and relevance of the curated dataset.
- Adherence to the tutorial instructions.
- Creativity in choosing the theme or subject.
- Depth of reflection and analysis in the final report.

Think about the questions that you can answer by running an object detector on your data. How about counting the number of humans in a picture? Or if there are pools in the picture of a backyard? 
* Try [Cleanlab](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab) on the images that you have downloaded

#### Note
Please ensure that you adhere to ethical guidelines and legal requirements while curating the dataset. Respect copyright laws and consider privacy concerns related to the images you are collecting.
